            I'm a software developer who believes in writing clean, readable, and well tested code. I am a life learner
            who enjoys working with the newest technologies, but also appreciates and enjoys working with older more
            mature technologies.

            I have been interested in programming since I was 12 when a friend showed me how to make a simple html
            webpage. From there my interest grew and I built my first website with pleasant MIDI background music and
            more gifs than actual content. I am now 31, and I've come a long way since then, but my enjoyment of
            programming remains.

            My current interests include micro-services, responsive mobile apps, GraphQL, Spring Boot, and Angular. I
            always have a few learning projects on the go, that I always hope to finish but never do.

            I enjoy talking about software development and working on software projects. If you have anything that might
